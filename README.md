# harshpreet.live

This repository contains the source code for my personal website: **harshpreet.live**.

The site is built using plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I’m intentionally keeping it lightweight and framework-free while I learn the fundamentals of web development.

## Purpose

The main goal of this website is to act as:
- A personal portfolio
- A central place to link my projects and socials
- A showcase of my progress in web development over time

I plan to continuously update and improve this site as I learn new technologies and build more projects.
